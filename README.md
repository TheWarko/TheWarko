## My Journey
With 15+ years in tech, I’ve grown from web developer to Frontend Product Engineer. Early in my career, I built skills in ASP , SQL, and
JavaScript, mastering jQuery and SCSS. My passion for frontend development led me to adopt modern frameworks like React with
Typescript and stay current with industry trends.
In the past five years, I co-founded an MPM startup, leading the Winker app’s development and then working in Mailup. These
experiences ignited a passion for product and fueled a deep appreciation for agile methodologies like Scrum. It inspired a strong
motivation to create user-centric solutions that deliver real value. I believe teamwork, adaptability, and continuous learning are
essential to building impactful products.
Today, I am driven by the desire to collaborate on innovative products, leveraging my technical expertise and commitment to user
experience to deliver meaningful solutions. I believe that working together isn't just more effective — it's more fun.


## Who is a Frontend Product Engineer
A Frontend Product Engineer connects design, development, and user experience. Unlike a traditional frontend developer, we ensure
every interaction aligns with user needs and business goals.
This role requires strong frontend technical skills, along with a product-oriented mindset. As Product Engineers, we work closely with
cross-functional teams of designers, PMs, and backend engineers to drive iterative improvements and enhance user engagement.
A Frontend Product Engineer embodies adaptability, a user-first approach, and agile development principles. We write clean,
maintainable code and actively shape the product’s evolution to deliver lasting user value.
